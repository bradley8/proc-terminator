# proc-terminator
Easily terminate large numbers of processes i.e. Chrome, Excel etc. There are many applications that leave lots of processes running even after you've closed the app. Some are legitimate background processes but some can be orphaned processes. This utility terminates them for a clean slate when developing or troubleshooting something.
